      “A room without books is like a body without a soul.”
  
      “The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.”
  
      “Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”
  
      “Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”
  
      “Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.”
  
      “I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.”
  
      “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”
  
      “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
  
      “If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.”

      “I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.”
  
      “There is no friend as loyal as a book.”
  
      “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”
  
      “It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it.”
  
      “One must always be careful of books," said Tessa, "and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us.”
  
      “If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.”
